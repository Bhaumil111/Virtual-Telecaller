CodeZen Labs is a rapidly growing SaaS company focused on delivering developer-centric productivity tools and cloud-native solutions for agile software teams. Headquartered in Bengaluru and founded in 2020, CodeZen aims to simplify DevOps, improve code collaboration, and accelerate software release cycles for teams of all sizes.

Our core product, ZenDeploy, is a continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) platform that allows developers to build, test, and ship code faster than ever. With built-in Docker support, multi-cloud compatibility (AWS, Azure, GCP), and seamless Git integrations, ZenDeploy enables teams to automate deployments with ease.

We also offer ZenTrack, an intelligent issue and sprint tracking tool designed for fast-moving product teams. It combines traditional Kanban boards with AI-based velocity prediction and burnout prevention alertsâ€”ideal for remote and hybrid teams.

For real-time documentation, we provide ZenDoc, a collaborative markdown editor that syncs with your codebase and auto-generates API references, changelogs, and usage guides. Dev teams love how it bridges the gap between code and documentation, all in one place.

Our SaaS offerings are built on a microservices architecture, optimized for high availability, and are fully scalable with enterprise-grade security. All tools are accessible through a unified dashboard and support role-based access controls (RBAC), SSO, and audit logs.
