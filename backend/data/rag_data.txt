PixelForge Arena is a cloud-native SaaS gaming company that blends competitive eSports with casual gaming in a unified digital ecosystem. Founded in 2022, PixelForge helps gamers worldwide experience fast, immersive gameplay with friends and global opponents—right from the browser, without downloads or high-end hardware.

At the heart of PixelForge is ArenaCloud, a real-time cloud gaming platform offering a wide range of multiplayer titles built in-house and by partner studios. ArenaCloud lets players jump into high-speed matches, tournaments, and ranked ladders using just a stable internet connection and a basic device.

One of our flagship games is CyberClash 2050, a fast-paced, team-based tactical shooter with dynamic maps, skill-based matchmaking, and customizable agents. Another popular title is Drift Dynasty, a physics-accurate racing game where players drift through cyberpunk-inspired cities, earn garage upgrades, and race in live events.

Core Features of ArenaCloud:

One-click game launch from browser or mobile

Auto cloud save with cross-device sync

Team voice chat and social lobbies
